## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

- At one point, Carmen says that "if you want to learn [something], you'll learn it." I couldn't agree more with this. I experienced this firsthand when I was in college and had to catch up to my peers. Having attended unregulated schools, I knew very little of the outside world; but I was able to push through and learn the things that had challenged me because I truly desired the knowledge. True, honest desire can be life-altering.

- I liked Carmen's point about changing her immediate response to failure. She made a conscious choice not to panic when her code failed, and that shift enabled her to calmly research and solve issues. My wife Bethany has told me that panic is the choice to suffer twice. If you avoid panic, then at the very worst you will only need to suffer once.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

- Like I mentioned earlier, it was a struggle to overcome my educational background. I was taught improper science, convoluted math, and highly censored history from teachers who lacked licenses (and in the case of some, degrees in their respective subjects). I believed that my resultant failures were my own, and that there was little hope. Attending college, however, I found a love for learning I hadn't felt before; it was then that I decided to challenge myself daily, not for a title, but for the joy of learning and for the desire to expand my horizons.

- With that said, I have always struggled to set incremental goals and follow a strict schedule. This may be due to ADHD, but I know I can improve if I challenge myself. (It just happens that this particular challenge is very, very boring...)

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Across most recipe sites that run on user contribution, I believe arrays are used for displaying ingredient lists. Unless a plain, expandable text box is used, the site likely has a feature for controlling portion size. This would require an array of manipulable variables. Indexing each ingredient would provide a reference point for the respective measurement to be changed via a script.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is a line of code used to change, sort, or quantify the contents of an array. Without an array method, changing an array would require that the programmer sift through the entire array to find the correct variable(s) to alter. This is impractical as some arrays contain hundreds or even thousands of variables. Array methods take away the manual element and even allow scripts to increment actions repeatedly through multiple cycles.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

Loops are used when a specific action needs to be repeated multiple times before a result can be calculated. A loop instructs the browser or app to calculate one result then repeat the process until an end point is reached. This end point is determined by the parameters of the loop, and often involves a hard limit on iteration count. The rest of the script will not complete until the loop reaches this end point.

By adding an array to a loop, the script is instructed to run the loop on each variable in the array. Additional parameters or code allow the programmer to specify which parts of the array should be put through the loop, allowing for a lower total requirement of processing power. Because each data type represented in the array can vary, the conjunction of loops and arrays can provide a wealth of information to the user or developer in a short amount of time.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

Could you count to ten for me? I'm sure you can! But how do you know when to stop counting?

That seems like a silly question, doesn't it? You know to stop at ten because I told you to stop at ten. It's easy for you because you're smart, and human brains are very good at solving problems like that.

But can a computer think? It might seem like it, but computers aren't as smart as you or me. You can do lots of things whenever you want - you can run, play, draw, and say anything you want. If you're being naughty, you might even choose to break rules sometimes too.

Computers are different. They have to follow instructions, and they can't break any rules. If I told you to count to ten but said a word funny, you would still know what I mean. If I mess up while giving a computer instructions though, it won't understand what I mean at all! It could keep counting and counting, or maybe even stop before it does anything! Because of this, you use something called a loop. You tell the computer what to do, and on every step it asks checks your instructions to see if it's on the right track.

To make a computer count to ten, you tell it to start from zero, and then you tell it to stop counting if the number is higher than ten. Makes sense, right? So the computer thinks like this:

- I'm on 0! That's less than 10. I should make the number higher.
- I'm on 1! That's better, but it's less than 10. Let's go higher.
- I'm on 2! Still under 10, so I need to make the number higher.

It goes up and up and up until it reaches 10. But does it stop? Almost! The computer hits 10 and then thinks,

- I'm on 10! Is this right? Hm, let me go higher one more time.
- Uh oh, now I'm at 11! This one is bigger than 10, so I can't use it. That must mean I'm all done!

So that's what a loop is: a set of instructions that tells a computer to do one thing, then check if it's right, and then do it again until it gets the right answer.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I think that 5-year-old question sorted it out for me, actually!
