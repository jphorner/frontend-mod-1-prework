## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
// My main takeaway from this article is that super learners treat the process of growth as rewarding in its own right. Rather than focusing solely on goals, they try to absorb whatever knowledge comes their way and reinforce it through teaching others. This is something I already do, and I was surprised to see it written out like this when I opened the article for the first time.
// The area I struggle most with is taking care of my brain as mentioned in number 5. I used to eat healthier when I was in college, but over time I have lapsed a bit in my efforts. This is mostly due to financial constraints, but once I receive the cost-of-living loans I fully intend to start eating healthy again. I also plan on doing light exercise every day.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
// In this section we learned about strings, booleans, and numbers.
// Strings are a data type made up of words, letters, or phrases.
// They can be combined with other variables for adaptational outputs.
// Booleans are variables that return either "true" or "false" and nothing else.
// They are best used in conditional logic.
// Numbers are about what you would expect, but they can be divided into integers and floats.
// A float is simply a number with a floating decimal.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log(`"Hello world!"`);

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// Comments are written using two backslashes at the beginning of the text.
// Comments help explain the rationale behind a piece of code.
// This prevents developers from wasting time trying to dissect each piece of code for its meaning.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
// A variable is like a Lego block. Each Lego does something different, but all of them come together neatly to make a larger structure.
// Just like Legos, everyone builds things differently. A builder might make something they think is nice, but anyone playing with the structure can take blocks off and put new ones on. Legos make it easy to change something small while not ruining the whole structure.
// Best of all, each type of Lego does something different! Some are easier to take off and change than others; some are pretty but not very useful; and some move and change depending on how the user decides to play with it.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
// I use YouTube frequently. User profiles likely contain variables for names (strings), subscriber counts (numbers), and an indicator of whether the user is verified (booleans).

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
// Concatenation is a way to combine multiple data types using the '+' operator. Separating data types out in this way instructs the computer to treat each separate component as its own variable type, and after the variables are interpreted they are re-combined into a single string of data.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
// When I was younger I used to play the MMORPG Maplestory obsessively. Throughout the game you encounter many NPCs who offer you quests, and I believe the developers used concatenation frequently in the text. This is because throughout the dialogue, the NPCs will occasionally reference you by name, as well as request that you kill a certain number of specific enemies.
// The names of the enemies as well as the numbers always appeared in colored text which stood out from the rest of the dialogue. I can't verify whether concatenation or interpolation were used specifically, but it was likely one of those two.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
